1. How long did you spend on the evaluation?
- I was working with hubstaff tracker, and for this test_app I spent ~8 hours.

2. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
- Probably because of my backend background, first of all I like to create file structure, separate different component, create constants for routes etc... Maybe this part I like better than all.
  It this application I first time used  CubeProvider, and I like this part also. Everything else is the same as in most react applications and I can't proud for it.
  Also I worked with amcharts and get small experience with it. For now I've still interesting working with this library.
  
3. Which parts did you spend the most time on? What was the most difficult aspect?
- Reading armchart and cube.js docs, and trying to implement this.

4. How did you like the evaluation overall? Did you run into any issues or have trouble completing?
- I think that this is the best way to know moore information about developer skills.
  About trouble completing - nope, I like all.
  To be honest, I'm not a big fan of heroku, instead of this I deploy my apps in gcloud, aws, firebase or my loved raspberryPI :)
  
5. Do you have any suggestions or improvements for how we could improve the evaluation in your mind?
- It would be good if in the description there was a request to use a typescript.
  I not used it because I'm lazy, and did this test after work :)
  And maybe it will be great if backend can  return responses for all cards and table.
